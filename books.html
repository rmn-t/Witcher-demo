              The Last Wish (Polish: Ostatnie życzenie) is the first book in
              Andrzej Sapkowski's The Witcher series in terms of story
              chronology, although the original Polish edition was published in
              1993, after Sword of Destiny. Some of the individual short stories
              were first published in the Fantastyka magazine or in the Wiedźmin
              short story collection (the first collection of Sapkowski's
              stories, out of print and now obsolete; all short stories were
              later collected in The Last Wish, Sword of Destiny and Something
              Ends, Something Begins) and as such were the first witcher stories
              published.

              David French. It's available in hardcover, paperback, and digital
