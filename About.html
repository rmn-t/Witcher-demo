          <p class="text-align-justify">
            Geralt of Rivia was a legendary witcher of the School of the Wolf
            active throughout the 13th century. He loved the sorceress Yennefer,
            considered the love of his life despite their tumultuous
            relationship, and became Ciri's adoptive father.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="text-align-justify">
            During the Trial of the Grasses, Geralt exhibited unusual tolerance
            for the mutagens that grant witchers their abilities. Accordingly,
            Geralt was subjected to further experimental mutagens which rendered
            his hair white and may have given him greater speed, strength, and
            stamina than his fellow witchers.

            Cirilla Fiona Elen Riannon (better known as Ciri), was born in 1252
            or 1253, and most likely during the Belleteyn holiday. She was the
            sole princess of Cintra, the daughter of Pavetta and Emhyr var
            Emreis (who was using the alias "Duny" at the time) as well as Queen
            Calanthe's granddaughter.

          <p class="text-align-justify">
            After Geralt of Rivia helped lift Duny's curse, Duny asked what
            reward the witcher would like and Geralt proclaimed the Law of
            Surprise, as it turned out Pavetta was pregnant with Ciri,
            unbeknownst to Duny.

          <p class="text-align-justify">
            Yennefer of Vengerberg, born on Belleteyn in 1173, was a sorceress
            who lived in Vengerberg, the capital city of Aedirn. She was Geralt
            of Rivia's true love and a mother figure to Ciri, whom she viewed
            like a daughter to the point that she did everything she could to
            rescue the girl and keep her from harm.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="text-align-justify">
            She helped advise King Demavend of Aedirn (though was never a formal
            royal advisor), a close friend of Triss Merigold, and the youngest
            member of the Supreme Council of Sorcerers within the Brotherhood of
            Sorcerers. After its fall, the Lodge of Sorceresses attempted to
            recruit her, but they didn't see eye to eye as the Lodge wanted to
            advance their own political agenda by using Ciri.

            Triss Merigold of Maribor was a legendary Temerian sorceress of the
            13th century. Called Fourteenth of the Hill by her contemporaries
            because she was erroneously thought to have been killed during the
            Battle of Sodden Hill, she passed into history as Merigold the
            Fearless. A member of King Foltest's royal council along with
            Fercart and Keira Metz, as well as a founding member of the Lodge of
            Sorceresses, she was involved in politics for most of her life.

          <br />
          <p class="text-align-justify">
            She was friends with Yennefer and the witcher Geralt of Rivia, but
            also unhappily in love with the latter. Triss took care of Ciri at
            Kaer Morhen for some time and is like an older sister to her. It was
            through her intervention that Ciri was not subjected to harmful
            hormone changes at Kaer Morhen, stripping her of her secondary
            gender traits.

            Julian Alfred Pankratz, Viscount de Lettenhove, better known as
            Dandelion (Polish: Jaskier), was a poet, minstrel, bard, and close
            friend of Geralt of Rivia.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p class="text-align-justify">
            During his travels with Geralt, Dandelion started to write his
            memoirs, entitled "Half a Century of Poetry"; twice, in fact. His
            first attempt was lost in the bottom of the duchess of Toussaint's
            closet after the poet was banished from her duchy. But rather than
            bemoaning that loss, the poet decided to rewrite his memoirs from
            scratch. His poems were later bound in two collections: The
            Adversities of Loving and Time of the Moon.
