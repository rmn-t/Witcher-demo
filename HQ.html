      <div class="text-primary text-align-justify">
        <br />
        <p>
          Kaer Morhen (Elder Speech: Caer a'Muirehen, meaning Keep of the Elder
          Sea) is an old keep where witchers of the School of the Wolf used to
          be trained. The name is a corruption of Caer a'Muirehen, revealing
          that there used to be sea around it, which is further indicated by the
          presence of fossilized sea creatures embedded in the stones on which
          it was built. However, by the 1200s it is located in the mountains of
          the kingdom of Kaedwen, right off the Gwenllech river.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The castle can only be reached by "The Witchers Trail", which is easy
          to miss, and encircles the keep. It is often given the nickname "The
          Killer" by young witchers.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In older times, witchers trained and underwent mutations here, but
          fanatics who considered witchers an abomination attacked the keep and
          killed most of the teachers and students. Vesemir was the last known
          witcher to live in the keep, although other witchers sometimes rested
          here between their assignments, often during the winter, after which
          they set out on The Path again.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1232, Eskel's surprise child, Deidre Ademeyn, took refuge here as
          those pursuing her didn't dare enter with the witchers around.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In 1270, Kaer Morhen was a ruin of its former self, with only a few
          witchers remaining. During this time, Triss Merigold was staying here
          with the remaining witchers when an unconscious Geralt was found near
          the fortress. Soon after he regained consciousness, the fortress came
          under attack by a criminal organization, the Salamandra, and the
          school's closely guarded herbs that were once used for the Trial of
          the Grasses were stolen and Leo was killed. After Leo was buried just
          outside Kaer Morhen, the witchers aided by Triss left in different
          directions to learn more about their attackers and recover the
          ingredients.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          A couple years later in 1272, the witchers of the school once more met
          up here on learning that Ciri was back but being chased by the Wild
          Hunt. Yennefer arrived before Geralt to begin preparations, as she
          wished to use the first part of the Trial of the Grasses on Uma, an
          odd creature that was their only link to learning what happened to
          Ciri. After a successful transformation, Geralt headed out and soon
          brought Ciri back, but with the Wild Hunt right on their tail. During
          the Battle of Kaer Morhen, the group tried various tactics to defend
          their home, but were eventually overpowered, resulting in Vesemir's
          death, until Ciri's Elder Blood activated, threatening to destroy not
          just the Wild Hunt members but the entire fortress along with it.
          However, a weakened Avallac'h was able to stop her.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          The remaining allies then held a pyre funeral for Vesemir before the
          witchers decided to go their separate ways, leaving Kaer Morhen
          behind.
